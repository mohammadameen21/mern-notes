👅 NODE JS 👅
Make sure you should get output in output not in terminal please uncheck "run in terminal"

⭐ How to import Modules
const { fileLoader } = require("ejs");
const data = require("./data");

🔥

⭐ Is node.js sync or async?
Node.js is async because if we have three command and second command take 3 second and  third command takes 1 second then Node.js don't wait for 2nd command it will execute the 3rd command and 2nd simultaneously. this is why node.js is super fast.

🔥


⭐ Importing other file in this file or module

You cannot use import in Nodejs but you can use that in Javascript

📁 ExternalModule.js
module.exports={
    x:10,
    y:20,
}



📁 File.js
const app = require('./ExternalModule')

console.log(app.x); Ouput -> 10
console.log(app.y); Ouput -> 20
console.log(app); Ouput -> {x: 10, y: 20, z:[Function: z]}

🔥

⭐ Exporting Function

There are two methods

👉 Mothod - 1

📁 file_one.js
module.exports={
    y:function(){
        return 100
    },
    z:function(){
        let name = 'Mohammad Ameen';
        console.log(name)
    },
    firstName : "Mohammad",
    lastName : "Ameen",
    gender : "Male",
    age : [
        1,2,3
    ],
    fullName: function(){
        return this.firstName+" "+this.lastName;
    },
    currentTime : function(){

        return new Date().toLocaleTimeString();
    },
    currentDate : function(){
        return new Date().toLocaleDateString();
    }
}

📁 file_two.js
const call = require('./practice_two')

console.log(call.y()); Output -> 100
call.z();              Output -> Mohammad Ameen


👉 Mothod - 2

📁 Second.js File
exports.mydate = function(){
  return Date();
}

exports.mytime = function(){
  return new Date().toDateString();
}

exports.age = 89;

exports.name = "Mohammad Ameen";


📁 Main.js File
const date = require('./secondfile');

console.log(date.mydate());
console.log(date.mytime());
console.log(date.age);

🔥

⭐ Github

👇 Concept  
Que -> How can we commit our code and push to the github from the visual studio code?
Ans -> just run -> npm init command and this will ask for repository provide repository and just enter.
👆

👇 Concept  
Que -> How can i ignore node_modules folder on pushing to git?
Ans -> just create .gitignore file inside project folder directory and write
/node_modules
👆

🔥

⭐ Filter function in Javascript

const arr = [2,3,4,3,4];

let result = arr.filter((item) =>{
    return 3==item
})

console.log(result)

Output -> [3,3]

🔥

⭐ Modules in Node.js

👇
Core Modules 
We get already written code which we can use in our projects, core modules are of two type
eg. console, buffer, fs, http

a -> Global Modules
     eg -> console
b -> Non-Global Modules
     Needs to be import or in other words import class create its object and use there operations
     eg. fs, colors, http etc.
👆


👇 Custom module 
Create your own module

📁 myfirstmodule.js file
exports.myDateTime = function () {
    return Date();
};

📁 Main.js File 
var http = require('http');
var dt = require('./myfirstmodule');

http.createServer(function (req, res) {
  res.writeHead(200, {'Content-Type': 'text/html'});
  res.write("The date and time are currently: " + dt.myDateTime());
  res.end();
}).listen(8080);

🔥

  THEORY KNOWLEDGE FOR INTERVIEWS
  
📑http -> The Built-in HTTP Module
Node.js has a built-in module called HTTP, which allows Node.js to transfer data over the Hyper Text Transfer Protocol (HTTP).
To include the HTTP module, use the require() method:
var http = require('http');
📑

📑 Add an HTTP Header
If the response from the HTTP server is supposed to be displayed as HTML, you should include an HTTP header with the correct content type:
Syntax -> res.writeHead(200, {'Content-Type': 'text/html'});
📑

📑createServer -> Node.js as a Web Server
The HTTP module can create an HTTP server that listens to server ports and gives a response back to the client.
Use the createServer() method to create an HTTP server:

Example
Get your own Node.js Server
var http = require('http');

//create a server object:
http.createServer(function (req, res) {
  res.write('Hello World!'); //write a response to the client
  res.end();                 //end the response
}).listen(8080);             //the server object listens on port 8080

The function passed into the http.createServer() method, will be executed when someone tries to access the computer on port 8080.
📑


📑 req and resp argument
Read the Query String
The function passed into the http.createServer() has a req argument that represents the request from the client, as an object (http.IncomingMessage object).

This object has a property called "url" which holds the part of the url that comes after the domain name:

eg.
var http = require('http');
http.createServer(function (req, res) {
  res.writeHead(200, {'Content-Type': 'text/html'});
  res.write(req.url);
  res.end();
}).listen(8080);

Added helloworld in Url after port number
http://localhost:8787/helloworld

result -> /helloworld
📑

📑Split the Query String
There are built-in modules to easily split the query string into readable parts, such as the URL module.

Example
Split the query string into readable parts:

var http = require('http');
var url = require('url');

http.createServer(function (req, res) {
  res.writeHead(200, {'Content-Type': 'text/html'});
  var q = url.parse(req.url, true).query;
  var txt = q.year + " " + q.month;
  res.end(txt);
}).listen(8080);
Save the code above in a file called "demo_querystring.js" and initiate the file:

Initiate demo_querystring.js:

C:\Users\Your Name>node demo_querystring.js
The address:

http://localhost:8080/?year=2017&month=July

Will produce this result:

2017 July
📑

👆


Note -> Package and module are not different they are same just name are alternative.

🔥

⭐ fs Module 
Common use for the File System module:

a) Read files -> 
The fs.readFile() method is used to read files on your computer.

Example -> Get your own Node.js Server
var http = require('http');
var fs = require('fs');
http.createServer(function (req, res) {

  // If you are in any folder then 'FolderName/demofile1.html'
  fs.readFile('demofile1.html', function(err, data) {
    res.writeHead(200, {'Content-Type': 'text/html'});
    res.write(data);
    return res.end();
  });
}).listen(8080);


b) Create files -> 

The File System module has 3 methods for creating new files:

1) fs.appendFile() -> The fs.appendFile() method appends specified content to a file. If the file does not exist, the file will be created:

Example

var fs = require('fs');

fs.appendFile('mynewfile1.txt', 'Hello content!', function (err) {
  if (err) throw err;
  console.log('Saved!');
});

2) fs.open() -> The fs.open() method takes a "flag" as the second argument, if the flag is "w" for "writing", the specified file is opened for writing. If the file does not exist, an empty file is created:

Example
Create a new, empty file using the open() method:

var fs = require('fs');

fs.open('mynewfile2.txt', 'w', function (err, file) {
  if (err) throw err;
  console.log('Saved!');
});


3) fs.writeFile() -> The fs.writeFile() method replaces the specified file content if it exists. If the file does not exist, a new file, containing the specified content, will be created:

Example
Create a new file using the writeFile() method:

var fs = require('fs');

fs.writeFile('mynewfile3.txt', 'Hello content!', function (err) {
  if (err) throw err;
  console.log('Saved!');
});


c) Update files ->

The File System module has two methods for updating files:

fs.appendFile()
fs.writeFile()

The fs.appendFile() method appends the specified content at the end of the specified file:

Example
Append "This is my text." to the end of the file "mynewfile1.txt":

var fs = require('fs');

fs.appendFile('mynewfile1.txt', ' This is my text.', function (err) {
  if (err) throw err;
  console.log('Updated!');
});

The fs.writeFile() method replaces the specified file and content:

Example
Replace the content of the file "mynewfile3.txt":

var fs = require('fs');

fs.writeFile('mynewfile3.txt', 'This is my text', function (err) {
  if (err) throw err;
  console.log('Replaced!');
});


d) Delete files -> 

To delete a file with the File System module,  use the fs.unlink() method.
The fs.unlink() method deletes the specified file:

Example
Delete "mynewfile2.txt":

var fs = require('fs');

fs.unlink('mynewfile2.txt', function (err) {
  if (err) throw err;
  console.log('File deleted!');
});


e) Rename files ->

To rename a file with the File System module,  use the fs.rename() method.
The fs.rename() method renames the specified file:

Example
Rename "mynewfile1.txt" to "myrenamedfile.txt":

var fs = require('fs');

fs.rename('mynewfile1.txt', 'myrenamedfile.txt', function (err) {
  if (err) throw err;
  console.log('File Renamed!');
});



f) fs Module Other operations

writeFileSync('file.txt', 'Content') -> This is used for the replace content of the file is file exist otherwise new file will be created.

const fs = require('fs')
fs.writeFileSync("Hello.txt","Code step by step");


⭐ writeFileSync v/s writeFile

fs.writeFileSync( file, data, options )
fs.writeFile( file, data, options, callback)

The Asynchronous function has a callback function as the last parameter which indicates the completion of the asynchronous function.

The ‘fs’ module implements the File I/O operation. Methods in the fs module can be synchronous as well as asynchronous. 
Developers prefer asynchronous methods over synchronous methods as they never block a program during its execution, whereas the later does. Blocking the main thread is "malpractice" in Node.js, thus synchronous functions should only be used for "debugging" or when no other options are available.

The fs.writeFileSync() is a synchronous method & creates a new file if the specified file does not exist while fs.writeFile() is an asynchronous method.


⭐ Print directories

console.log("->>",__dirname); // Gives Path till file folder
->> c:\Users\under\OneDrive\Desktop\Mohd Ameen\MeanStack

console.log("->>", __filename); // Gives file Path
->> c:\Users\under\OneDrive\Desktop\Mohd Ameen\MeanStack\fileName.js  


🔥




⭐ http Module

const http = require('http');

http.createServer((req, resp) =>{

    resp.write("Hello this is Mohammad Ameen");
    resp.end();

}).listen(9088);


     or You can pass function to createServer make sure!

const http = require('http');
const dataControl = (req,resp) => {
    resp.write("<h1>Hello, this is Developer Mohammad Ameen</h1>");
    resp.end();
}

http.createServer(dataControl).listen(4500);
🔥

⭐ All about package
npm -> Node Package Manager, NPM is a package manager for Node.js packages or modules. www.npmjs.com hosts thousands of free packages to download and use. The NPM program is installed on your computer when you install Node.js. NPM is already ready to run on your computer!

package.json file -> This file keeps record of our Node project i.e what are the package have been use in our project, The package. json file is the heart of any Node project. It records important metadata about a project which is required before publishing to NPM, and also defines functional attributes of a project that npm uses to install dependencies, run scripts, and identify the entry point to our package.

npm init
This utility will walk you through creating a package.json file.
It only covers the most common items, and tries to guess sensible defaults.

See `npm help init` for definitive documentation on these fields
and exactly what they do.

save it as a dependency in the package.json file.

Press ^C at any time to quit.
package name: (meanstack)

Important Note -> You can directly run npm i colors command and install the colors package and use there funtions you don't need to install init npm or create package.json file it will works perfectly without that.

👇 How to install packages
Color package, chalk package etc.
npm install colors or npm i colors
const colors = require('colors');
console.log("package.json".bgGreen);
👆


👇
Nodemon package
npm i nodemon -g -> This command will install nodemon globally means we dont need to install nodemon for indivisual project. if any error then long click on cammand prompt and click run as adminitrator.

npm i nodemon -> This will install in our project only.
This package works as live server in terminal used for quickly update code and show output in terminal it saves time.
console.log("Nodemon package");
console.log("Code step by step");
console.log(10+100);
👆


👇 Interview question 
Que -> If we share our project with someone how he will identify what are the package have been use in this project?
Ans -> He can check the package.json file dependencies object to identify what are the packages been use in this project and he don't use to install packages one by one he need to just rum in terminal npm install command by given this command all the packages get add in our project which are mention in package.json file.
npm install

Now we don't run .js file like node ./app.js we will use nodemon ./app.js for continueously update the terminal.

👆

👇 Concept  
Que -> If we install only two packages i.e colors and simple-code-logger then why we are getting more than two package in node_modules folder.
Ans -> Because the packages which we install are dependent on other packages as well they are need of there other package as well to complete their task thats why they went install.

👆


👇 Concept  
Que -> What package-lock.json file is?
Ans -> It has more brief information about the package which we install in our project, in package.json file we only see the package name and version but in package-lock.json file we have more information about the individual packages which are installed.

👆

👇 Concept  
Que -> Is node.js multitheaded or single-threaded?
Ans -> Node.js is single-threaded because it can process only one command at a time we cannot run multiple command at the same time.


Single thread: Node JS Platform doesn’t follow the Multi-Threaded Request/Response Stateless Model. It follows the Single-Threaded with Event Loop Model. Node JS Processing model mainly inspired by JavaScript Event-based model with JavaScript callback mechanism. Because of which Node.js can handle more concurrent client requests with ease. The event loop is the heart of the Node.js processing model as shown below diagram

👆

👇 Concept  
Que -> What happend if node_module folder gets delete?
Ans -> No problem we record of our package name in our package.json file we can install one by one although use the short cut i.e npm install which will install all the packages which are using in our node project.

👆

👇 Concept  
Que -> Should we push node_module folder on github ?
Ans -> We shouldn't because of too large size file hence make use of gitignore file /node_module this will push everything on github except the node_module folder

👆

👇 Concept  
When we installing any package from terminal then it's dependency gets add in the package.json file.

// ⭐ HTTP response status codes
// HTTP response status codes indicate whether a specific HTTP request has been successfully completed. Responses are grouped in five classes:

// Informational responses (100–199)
// Successful responses (200–299)
// Redirection messages (300–399)
// Client error responses (400–499)
// Server error responses (500–599)

// 🔥


// ⭐ is Node js Asynchronous?
    Yes, don't wait for other function if they need some time to finish their task

⭐ Make a simple API

const http = require('http');

http.createServer((req,resp)=>{
    resp.writeHead(200,{'Content-Type':'application\json'});
    resp.write(JSON.stringify({name:'Mohammad Ameen', email:'md.ameen1080@gmail.com'}));
    resp.end();
}).listen(6800);

👇 Simple api fetching data from other file i.e data.js
const http = require('http');
const data = require('./data');

http.createServer((req,resp)=>{
    resp.writeHead(200,{'Content-Type':'application\json'});
    resp.write(JSON.stringify(data));
    resp.end();
}).listen(5000);


JSON.stringify() method -> The JSON.stringify() static method converts a JavaScript value to a JSON string, optionally replacing values if a replacer function is specified or optionally including only the specified properties if a replacer array is specified.
A common use of JSON is to exchange data to/from a web server.
When sending data to a web server, the data has to be a string.
Convert a JavaScript object into a string with JSON.stringify().
👆

👅 data.js file
const data=[
  {name:'Mohammad Ameen',email:'md.ameen1080@gmail.com'},

⭐ Input from command line

👇 Taking input
const fs = require('fs');

const input = process.argv;
fs.writeFileSync(input[2],input[3]);

In terminal give command                                          
1st      -> index.js
2nd      -> apple.txt
3rd      -> 'I am color of red fruite'

C:\Users\under\OneDrive\Desktop\Mohd Ameen\Node Revission> node index.js apple.txt 'I am color of red fruite'
👆

👇 Deletion and Creation of file from terminal system

Delete cammand -> node node.js add orange.txt
Create cammand -> node node.js remove orange.txt

const fs = require('fs');
const input = process.argv;

if(input[2]=='add'){
    fs.writeFileSync(input[3],input[4]);

👆


👇 Sync vs Async

unlink vs unlinkSync || writeFile vs writeFileSync

Delete a file in Node.js Synchronously. This is helpful if statements next to the delete operation depend on the file you delete. unlinkSync() function makes sure that file is deleted(if it exists) before the execution of subsequent statements.

⭐ Path Module

The Path module provides a way of working with directories and file paths.

Syntax
The syntax for including the Path module in your application:

var path = require('path');

Path Properties and Methods
Method	        Description

👉 basename()	->    Returns the last part of a path
        var path = require('path');
        var filename = path.basename('/Users/Refsnes/demo_path.js');
        console.log(filename);
        Output -> demo_path.js


👉 dirname()	->  Returns the directories of a path
        var path = require('path');
        //Return the directries:
        var directories = path.dirname('/Users/Refsnes/demo_path.js');
        console.log(directories);
        Output -> /Users/Refsnes

👉 extname()	  ->  Returns the file extension of a path
        var path = require('path');
        //Return the extension:
        var ext = path.extname('/Users/Refsnes/demo_path.js');
        console.log(ext);
        Output -> .js

👉 format()	->    Formats a path object into a path string
            var path = require('path');
            //Create a path object:
            var obj = { dir: 'C:\\Users\\Refsnes', base: 'demo_path.js' }
            //Format the path object into a path string:
            var p = path.format(obj);
            console.log(p);
            Output -> C:\Users\Refsnes\demo_path.js

👉 isAbsolute() -> 	Returns true if a path is an absolute path, otherwise false
            var path = require('path');

            console.log(path.isAbsolute('/test/demo_path.js')); //true
            console.log(path.isAbsolute('test/demo_path.js')); //false
            console.log(path.isAbsolute('C:\\test\\demo_path.js')); //true

👉 join()	  ->      Joins the specified paths into one
            var path = require('path');

            var x = path.join('Users', 'Refsnes', 'demo_path.js');

            console.log(x);
            Output -> Users\Refsnes\demo_path.js

👉 normalize()	->    Normalizes the specified path
            var path = require('path');

            var x = path.normalize('Users/Refsnes/../Jackson');

            console.log(x);
            Output -> Users\Jackson

⭐ Asynchronous

👇 What is asynchronous?
In asynchronous second task won't wait to finish first task.

console.log("Start exe...");

setInterval(()=>{
console.log("Login exe...");
},2000);

console.log("Complete exe");

👆 


👇 Promises 
The Promise object represents the eventual completion (or failure) of an asynchronous operation and its resulting value.

let a=20;
let b=0;

let waitingData = new Promise((resolve,reject)=>{
    setTimeout(()=>{
        b=30;
        resolve(b);
    },2000)
})

Twenty will be print after 2sec
waitingData.then((data)=>{ // (data) coming from (resolve)
    b = data;
    console.log(a+b);
})


This is how we can handle the waiting period, result will be produce once setTimeOut get stop and update the value

 By using reject we can handle the errors 

👆

👇 Interview question

console.log("Starting up") // 1st

setTimeout(()=>{
    console.log("2 second log") // 4th
}, 2000)

setTimeout(()=>{
    console.log("2 second log") // 3rd
}, 0)

console.log("Finishing up") // 2nd

⭐ URL Module

👇 

The Built-in URL Module

The URL module splits up a web address into readable parts.

var url = require('url');

Parse an address with the url.parse() method, and it will return a URL object with each part of the address as properties:

Example - Get your own Node.js Server
Split a web address into readable parts:

var url = require('url');
var adr = 'http://localhost:8080/default.htm?year=2017&month=february';
var q = url.parse(adr, true);

console.log(q.host); //returns 'localhost:8080'
console.log(q.pathname); //returns '/default.htm'
console.log(q.search); //returns '?year=2017&month=february'

var qdata = q.query; //returns an object: { year: 2017, month: 'february' }
console.log(qdata.month); //returns 'february'

Node.js File Server
Now we know how to parse the query string, and in the previous chapter we learned how to make Node.js behave as a file server. Let us combine the two, and serve the file requested by the client.

Create two html files and save them in the same folder as your node.js files.

summer.html

<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<body>
<h1>Summer</h1>
<p>I love the sun!</p>
</body>
</html>

winter.html

<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<body>
<h1>Winter</h1>
<p>I love the snow!</p>
</body>
</html>


Create a Node.js file that opens the requested file and returns the content to the client. If anything goes wrong, throw a 404 error:

demo_fileserver.js:

var http = require('http');
var url = require('url');
var fs = require('fs');

http.createServer(function (req, res) {
  var q = url.parse(req.url, true);
  var filename = "." + q.pathname;
  fs.readFile(filename, function(err, data) {
    if (err) {
      res.writeHead(404, {'Content-Type': 'text/html'});
      return res.end("404 Not Found");
    } 
    res.writeHead(200, {'Content-Type': 'text/html'});
    res.write(data);
    return res.end();
  });
}).listen(8080);

Remember to initiate the file:

Initiate demo_fileserver.js:

C:\Users\Your Name>node demo_fileserver.js
If you have followed the same steps on your computer, you should see two different results when opening these two addresses:

http://localhost:8080/summer.html

Will produce this result:

Summer
I love the sun!

http://localhost:8080/winter.html

👇 What is NPM?

NPM is a package manager for Node.js packages, or modules if you like.

www.npmjs.com hosts thousands of free packages to download and use.

The NPM program is installed on your computer when you install Node.js

NPM is already ready to run on your computer!

What is a Package?
A package in Node.js contains all the files you need for a module.

Modules are JavaScript libraries you can include in your project.

Download a Package?
Downloading a package is very easy.

Open the command line interface and tell NPM to download the package you want.

I want to download a package called "upper-case":

Download "upper-case":

C:\Users\Your Name>npm install upper-case
Now you have downloaded and installed your first package!

NPM creates a folder named "node_modules", where the package will be placed. All packages you install in the future will be placed in this folder.

My project now has a folder structure like this:

C:\Users\My Name\node_modules\upper-case


Using a Package?
Once the package is installed, it is ready to use.

Include the "upper-case" package the same way you include any other module:

var uc = require('upper-case');
Create a Node.js file that will convert the output "Hello World!" into upper-case letters:

ExampleGet your own Node.js Server
var http = require('http');
var uc = require('upper-case');
http.createServer(function (req, res) {
  res.writeHead(200, {'Content-Type': 'text/html'});
  res.write(uc.upperCase("Hello World!"));
  res.end();
}).listen(8080);

Save the code above in a file called "demo_uppercase.js", and initiate the file:

Initiate demo_uppercase:

C:\Users\Your Name>node demo_uppercase.js
If you have followed the same steps on your computer, you will see the same result as the example: http://localhost:8080
